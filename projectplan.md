# Agent OS V2 - Conversational Multi-Agent System
## Project Plan

### üéØ Project Overview
Build a conversational multi-agent system that combines AgentScope's orchestration with Trigger.dev's infrastructure reliability. Four personality-driven agents (Alex, Dana, Riley, Jamie) engage in natural dialogue with users, ask proactive questions, and only transition to coordinated action after sufficient conversation.

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js with Shadcn UI
- **Backend**: FastAPI 
- **Database**: Supabase
- **Agent Orchestration**: AgentScope
- **Job Queue/Automation**: Trigger.dev
- **State Management**: React Context

## üìù Notes & Decisions Made

### Key Design Decisions:
- **Conversational-first approach**: Agents engage in natural dialogue before taking action
- **Proactive questioning**: Agents ask practical follow-up questions about timing, deadlines, preferences
- **Trigger.dev awareness**: Agents only offer options that can actually be executed (NEEDS IMPLEMENTATION)
- **Hybrid interaction modes**: Support both quick options and detailed text input
- **Personality-driven agents**: Each agent has distinct conversation style and expertise
- **@ mention system**: Direct agent targeting for focused conversations

### Technical Choices:
- AgentScope for multi-agent orchestration (proven, extensible)
- Trigger.dev for reliable job execution (NEEDS ACTUAL SETUP)
- Next.js + Shadcn UI for modern, accessible frontend
- FastAPI for high-performance backend
- Supabase for managed database and real-time features
- AES-256-GCM encryption for API key security

## üîÑ Review Section

### HONEST ASSESSMENT - What's Actually Working:

**‚úÖ FULLY WORKING:**
- **Backend**: Railway deployment at https://agentos-production-6348.up.railway.app ‚úÖ
- **Frontend**: Local development with @ mention functionality ‚úÖ
- **Agents**: Alex, Dana, Riley, Jamie all responding correctly ‚úÖ
- **Chat Interface**: Beautiful UI with agent selection and real-time messaging ‚úÖ
- **Settings UI**: Comprehensive settings page with API key management interface ‚úÖ
- **API Key Management**: Complete Supabase integration with AES-256-GCM encryption ‚úÖ
- **Database**: Sophisticated schema with encrypted storage and usage tracking ‚úÖ
- **Service Integrations**: Complete framework with Notion, Slack, Calendar, GitHub ‚úÖ

**‚ùå NOT ACTUALLY WORKING:**
- **Trigger.dev Integration**: Has mock code but no real setup
- **Automation Workflows**: Framework exists but no actual Trigger.dev connection
- **Job Execution**: Currently using mock responses, not real automation

**üéØ REALITY CHECK:**
We have a sophisticated conversational AI system with service integrations, but the automation layer (Trigger.dev) is not actually implemented - just planned and mocked.

**NEXT STEPS:**
Phase 7 needs to start from scratch with actual Trigger.dev setup, not just fixing configuration issues.

### üîß RECENT FIXES (June 15, 2025):

**‚úÖ SLACK OAUTH INTEGRATION FULLY FIXED:**
- **Problem**: OAuth flow was working (Slack authorization successful) but failing at token storage with "permission denied for schema public" error
- **Root Cause Analysis**: 
  1. Missing `encrypted_api_keys` table in Supabase database ‚úÖ FIXED
  2. Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on system tables blocking service role access ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Solution**: Used Supabase MCP and Context7 documentation to:
  - Created missing database tables with proper schema
  - Disabled RLS on internal system tables (`encrypted_api_keys`, `api_key_usage_logs`)
  - Granted proper permissions to service_role
- **Technical Details**:
  - Service role key correctly configured on Railway
  - Database tables created with AES-256-GCM encryption support
  - RLS disabled for system tables to allow admin operations
  - OAuth scopes: `chat:write`, `channels:read` (minimal working set)
- **Result**: Slack OAuth flow now works end-to-end:
  1. ‚úÖ Frontend "Connect Slack" button generates OAuth URL
  2. ‚úÖ User authorizes on Slack  
  3. ‚úÖ Slack redirects to callback with authorization code
  4. ‚úÖ Backend exchanges code for bot token
  5. ‚úÖ Bot token encrypted and stored in Supabase (PERMISSION ISSUE RESOLVED)
  6. ‚úÖ Agents can now send Slack messages using stored tokens

**Technical Details:**
- Database tables created with proper schema, indexes, and relationships
- Service role key already configured on Railway
- OAuth scopes: `chat:write`, `channels:read` (minimal working set)
- Callback URL: `https://agentos-production-6348.up.railway.app/integrations/slack/oauth/callback`
- All environment variables properly set on Railway
